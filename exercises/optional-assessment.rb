# Specifications:

# Write a Ruby program that allows two users to play a game of
# Nim together. If you are not familiar with the game start by
# reading the Nim Wikipedia article.

# At the start of the program you should accept each user's name.
# And allow them to choose the game difficulty (easy = 2 piles,
# medium = 3 piles, hard = 7 piles). Your game should then randomly
# decide who will go first.

# After the game finishes you should print each player's score
# for that game (they earn +1 point for being the player that does
# not remove the last counter) along with a summary of their moves.

# Your game should then prompt them to play another game or quit.
# If they choose to quit you should display total scores for each
# player across all played games, otherwise you should allow the
# two player's to play again.

# Each user must select at least one item to remove from each pile
# (they cannot remove 0 items). Make sure that users do not cheat,
# and that their moves are valid.
