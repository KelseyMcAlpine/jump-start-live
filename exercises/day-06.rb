# Day 6 Exercises

# Ask the user to enter the names, ages, and favorite colors of their
# closest friends (you may not assume that the user's close friends
# all have unique names). Output the total number of close friends
# under 18, followed by their names. Output the number of unique
# favorite colors, and then list them (Hint: Check out the uniq
# method of the Array class in Ruby). Your solution should use at
# least 1 hash and at least 1 array.
