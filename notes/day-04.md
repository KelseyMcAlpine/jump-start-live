# Day 4

## Boolean Zen
* Boolean zen is a phrase used to describe if code using boolean values is written in the most concise way possible.
* Boolean zen is considered good programming style.
* You should never compare to true or false in an if statement, while loop, or until loop.

## Advanced Loops

#### Fencepost Problems
* Sometimes illustrated as |-|-|-|-| with the | representing a fence post and the - representing the wire of the fence
* The idea is that you need 1 more post than you do wire sections; you begin with a post and end with a post
* Also sometimes called a _loop-and-a-half_
* Common solutions usually have the loop run one less times than needed and then handle the last post outside of the loop
